This is not an exact copy of the original, but rather an attempt to implement all the most important features of it in a way that would allow easy modification and creation of similarly styled geometric proofs.

Although Byrne's book looks cool as it is, it might be helpful, as Edward Tufte points out, to supplement it with conventional letter designations. So, there's also option for this.

In addition to all the colorful byrnian stuff, this edition features generated lettrines and vignettes, so there are no two identical initials in the whole book.
